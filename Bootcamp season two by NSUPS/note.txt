The C++ programming language is case-sensitive, so myVariable and myvariable are two different identifiers.

2.Always keep in mind that all variables must be defined with a name and a data type before they can be used.
3.As with cout, extractions on cin can be chained to request more than one input in a single statement: cin >> a >> b;
4.Specifying the data type for a given variable more than once results in a syntax error.
5.Dividing by 0 will crash your program.
6.Operator precedence determines the grouping of terms in an expression, which affects how an expression is evaluated. Certain operators take higher precedence over others; for example, the multiplication operator has higher precedence over the addition operator.
Parentheses force the operations to have higher precedence. If there are parenthetical expressions nested within one another, the expression within the innermost parentheses is evaluated first. 
If none of the expressions are in parentheses, multiplicative (multiplication, division, modulus) operators will be evaluated before additive (addition, subtraction) operators.
